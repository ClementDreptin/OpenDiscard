# OpenDiscard - Mobile App
OpenDiscard Mobile App is a mobile version of [OpenDiscard](https://github.com/ClementDreptin/OpenDiscard/) for Android.

### Technologies used
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

### Limitations
The app was built using [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) which provides support for both Android and iOS
but I was not able to build my app for iOS because I do not have a machine running macOS. This is why the app is only
available on Android. An iOS my come later.
